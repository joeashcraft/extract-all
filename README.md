extract-all
===========

Shell script to extract "any" compressed (or otherwise packaged, e.g. tar) file.

Inspired by [spsneo](http://spsneo.com/blog/2009/01/28/extract-all-archive-file-forma-with-just-one-command-in-linux/).

This can easily be used as a function in your .bashrc file.

## Known Issues

You need to run this twice for "tar.*" files.
